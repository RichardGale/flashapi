             * currently in the buffer, use the bufferLength property.To play a server-side playlist, set bufferTime to at least 1 second. If
             * you experience playback issues, increase the length of bufferTime.
             * Recorded content To avoid distortion when streaming pre-recorded (not live) content,
             * do not set the value of Netstream.bufferTime to 0. By default, the application
             * uses an input buffer for pre-recorded content that queues the media data and plays the media properly.
             * For pre-recorded content, use the default setting or increase the buffer time.Live content When streaming live content, set the bufferTime property to 0.Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player no longer clears the buffer
             * when NetStream.pause() is called. Before Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player
             * waited for the buffer to fill up before resuming playback, which often caused a delay.For a single pause, the NetStream.bufferLength property has a limit of either 60 seconds
             * or twice the value of NetStream.bufferTime, whichever value is higher. For example, if
             * bufferTime is 20 seconds, Flash Player buffers until NetStream.bufferLength
             * is the higher value of either 20~~2 (40), or 60. In this case it buffers until bufferLength is 60.
             * If bufferTime is 40 seconds, Flash Player buffers until bufferLength is the higher value
             * of 40~~2 (80), or 60. In this case it buffers until bufferLength is 80 seconds.The bufferLength property also has an absolute limit.
             * If any call to pause() causes bufferLength
             * to increase more than 600 seconds or the value of bufferTime ~~ 2, whichever is higher, Flash Player
             * flushes the buffer and resets bufferLength to 0. For example, if
             * bufferTime is 120 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer
             * if bufferLength reaches 600 seconds; if bufferTime is 360 seconds,
             * Flash Player flushes the buffer if bufferLength reaches 720 seconds.Tip: You can use NetStream.pause() in code to buffer data while viewers are watching
             * a commercial, for example, and then unpause when the main video starts.For more information about the new pause behavior,
             * see http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_smartpause_en.Flash Media Server. The buffer behavior depends on whether the buffer time is
             * set on a publishing stream or a subscribing stream.
             * For a publishing stream, bufferTime specifies how long the outgoing buffer can
             * grow before the application starts dropping frames.
             * On a high-speed connection, buffer time is not a concern; data is sent
             * almost as quickly as the application can buffer it. On a slow connection, however, there can
             * be a significant difference between how fast the application buffers the data and how fast it
             * is sent to the client.
             *
             *   For a subscribing stream, bufferTime specifies how long to buffer incoming
             * data before starting to display the stream.
             *
             *   When a recorded stream is played, if bufferTime is 0, Flash sets it to a small
             * value (approximately 10 milliseconds). If live streams are later played
             * (for example, from a playlist), this buffer time persists. That is, bufferTime
             * remains nonzero for the stream.

             * (by providing a value of 0) or a series of snapshots     in effect,
             * time-lapse footage     by providing a positive number that adds a trailer
             * of the specified number of milliseconds to the video feed. The trailer
             * extends the display time of the video message. By repeatedly
             * calling attachCamera() with a positive value for snapshotMilliseconds,
             * the sequence of alternating snapshots and trailers creates time-lapse footage.
             * For example, you could capture one frame per day and append it to a video file.
             * When a subscriber plays the file, each frame remains onscreen for the specified
             * number of milliseconds and then the next frame is displayed.The purpose of the snapshotMilliseconds parameter is different
             * from the fps parameter you can set with Camera.setMode(). When you specify
             * snapshotMilliseconds, you control how much time elapses between recorded frames. When
             * you specify fps using Camera.setMode(), you are
             * controlling how much time elapses during recording and playback.For example, suppose you want to take a snapshot every 5 minutes for a total
             * of 100 snapshots. You can do this in two ways:You can issue a NetStream.attachCamera(myCamera, 500) command
             * 100 times, once every 5 minutes. This takes 500 minutes to record, but the resulting file
             * will play back in 50 seconds (100 frames with 500 milliseconds between frames).You can issue a Camera.setMode() command with an fps value
             * of 1/300 (one per 300 seconds, or one every 5 minutes), and then issue a
             * NetStream.attachCamera(source) command, letting the camera capture continuously
             * for 500 minutes. The resulting file will play back in 500 minutes     the same length of time
             * that it took to record     with each frame being displayed for 5 minutes.Both techniques capture the same 500 frames, and both approaches are useful;
             * the approach to use depends primarily on your playback requirements. For example,
             * in the second case, you could be recording audio the entire time. Also, both files
             * would be approximately the same size.
             * @param   theCamera   The source of the video transmission. Valid values are a Camera object
             *   (which starts capturing video) and null. If you pass null,
             *   the application stops capturing video, and any additional parameters you send are ignored.
             * @param   snapshotMilliseconds    Specifies whether the video stream is continuous,
             *   a single frame, or a series of single frames used to create time-lapse photography.
             *

             * This method is available only to the publisher of the specified stream.
             * This method is available for use with Flash Media Server only.
             * To process and respond to this message, create a handler on the
             * NetStream object, for example, ns.HandlerName.
             *
             *   Flash Player or  AIR does not serialize methods
             * or their data, object prototype variables, or non-enumerable variables. For display objects,
             * Flash Player or  AIR serializes the path but none of the data.
             *
             *   You can call the send() method to add data keyframes to a live stream
             * published to Flash Media Server. A data keyframe is a message a publisher adds
             * to a live stream. Data keyframes are typically used to add metadata to a live stream
             * before data is captured for the stream from camera and microphone.
             * A publisher can add a data keyframe at any time while the live stream is being published.
             * The data keyframe is saved in the server's memory as long
             * as the publisher is connected to the server.
             *
             *   Clients who are subscribed to the live stream before a data keyframe is
             * added receive the keyframe as soon as it is added. Clients who subscribe
             * to the live stream after the data keyframe is added receive the keyframe
             * when they subscribe.
             *
             *   To add a keyframe of metadata to a live stream sent to Flash Media Server, use
             * @setDataFrame as the handler name,
             *   followed by two additional arguments, for example:
             *
             *     <codeblock>
             *
             *     var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc);
             *   ns.send("@setDataFrame", "onMetaData", metaData);
             *
             *     </codeblock>
             *
             *     The
             * @setDataFrame argument
             *   refers to a special handler built in to Flash Media Server.
             *   The onMetaData argument is the
             *   name of a callback function in your client application that
             *   listens for the onMetaData event and retrieves the metadata.
             *   The third item, metaData, is an instance
             *   of Object or Array
             *   with properties that define the metadata values.
             *   Use
             * @clearDataFrame to clear a keyframe
             *   of metadata that has already been set in the stream:
             *
             *     <codeblock>
             *
             *     ns.send("@clearDataFrame", "onMetaData");
             *
             *     </codeblock>
             * @param   handlerName The message to send; also the name of the ActionScript
             *   handler to receive the message. The handler name can be only one level deep
             *   (that is, it can't be of the form parent/child) and is relative to the stream object.
             *   Do not use a reserved term for a handler name.
             *   For example, using "close" as a handler name causes
             *   the method to fail.
             *   With Flash Media Server, use
             * @setDataFrame to add a
             *   keyframe of metadata to a live stream
             *   or
             * @clearDataFrame to remove a keyframe.
             * @param   arguments   Optional arguments that can be of any type. They are
             *   serialized and sent over the connection, and the receiving handler receives
             *   them in the same order. If a parameter is a circular object (for example,
             *   a linked list that is circular), the serializer handles the references correctly.
             *   With Flash Media Server,
             *   if
             * @setDataFrame is the first argument,
             *   use onMetaData as the second argument; for the third
             *   argument, pass an instance of Object
             *   or Array that has the metadata set as properties.
             *   See the

             * playback, which often caused a delay. Note: For backwards compatibility, the "NetStream.Buffer.Flush" event (see the NetStatusEvent.info

             * If bufferTime is 40 seconds, Flash Player buffers until bufferLength is the higher value
             * of 40~~2 (80), or 60, so in this case it buffers until bufferLength is 80 seconds.The bufferLength property also has an absolute limit.
             * If any call to pause() causes bufferLength

             * the beginning of the stream.
             *
             *   Video streams are usually encoded with two types of frames, keyframes (or I-frames)
             * and P-frames. A keyframe contains an entire image, while a P-frame is an
             * interim frame that provides additional video information between keyframes.
             * A video stream typically has a keyframe every 10-50 frames.
             * Flash Media Server has several types of seek behavior: enhanced seeking and smart seeking.Enhanced seeking Enhanced seeking is enabled by default. To disable enhanced seeking, on Flash Media Server set the EnhancedSeek
             * element in the Application.xml configuration file to false.
             * If enhanced seeking is enabled, the server generates
             * a new keyframe at offset based on the previous keyframe and any
             * intervening P-frames. However, generating keyframes creates a high processing load on the server
             * and distortion might occur in the generated keyframe.
             * If the video codec is On2, the keyframe before the seek point and any
             * P-frames between the keyframe and the seek point are sent to the client.
             *
             *   If enhanced seeking is disabled, the server starts streaming
             * from the nearest keyframe. For example, suppose a video has keyframes at 0 seconds
             * and 10 seconds. A seek to 4 seconds causes playback to start at 4 seconds
             * using the keyframe at 0 seconds. The video stays frozen until it reaches the
             * next keyframe at 10 seconds. To get a better seeking experience, you need to
             * reduce the keyframe interval. In normal seek mode, you cannot start the video
             * at a point between the keyframes.
             * Smart seekingTo enable smart seeking, set NetStream.inBufferSeek to true.Smart seeking allows Flash Player to seek within an existing back buffer and forward buffer. When smart seeking is disabled,
             * each time seek() is called Flash Player flushes the buffer and requests data from the server.
             * For more information, see NetStream.inBufferSeek.Seeking in Data Generation ModeWhen you call seek() on a NetStream in Data Generation Mode, all bytes passed to
             * appendBytes() are discarded (not placed in the buffer, accumulated in the partial message FIFO, or parsed for seek points)

             * to reset the parser. For information about Data Generation Mode, see NetStream.play().

             *   generates a keyframe at offset.
             *
             *     To return to the beginning of the stream, pass 0 for offset.To seek forward from the beginning of the stream, pass the number of seconds to advance.
             *   For example, to position the playhead at 15 seconds from the beginning (or the keyframe

             * For more information, see "Dynamic streaming" in the
             * "Adobe Flash Media Server Developer Guide".Adobe built a custom ActionScript class called DynamicStream that extends the NetStream class. You can use the DynamicStream class
             * to implement dynamic streaming in an application instead of writing your own code to detect network conditions. Even if you choose to write your own
             * dynamic streaming code, use the DynamicStream class as a reference implementation. Download the class and the class documentation at the
