             * to the specified childID.SELFLAG_EXTENDSELECTION: Calculate the range of child elements between
             * and including the selection anchor and the specified childID. If
             * SELFLAG_ADDSELECTION is present, add all of these child elements to the
             * selection. If SELFLAG_REMOVESELECTION is present, remove all of these child
             * elements from the selection. If neither SELFLAG_ADDSELECTION nor SELFLAG_REMOVESELECTION
             * is present, all of these child elements should take on the selection anchor's
             * selection state: if the selection anchor is selected, add these child elements
             * to the selection; otherwise remove them from the selection.SELFLAG_ADDSELECTION (without SELFLAG_EXTENDSELECTION): Add the specified
             * childID to the selection.SELFLAG_REMOVESELECTION (without SELFLAG_EXTENDSELECTION): Remove the
             * specified childID from the selection.Note that for a non-multi-selectable component, the only valid selFlag
             * parameter values are SELFLAG_TAKEFOCUS and SELFLAG_TAKESELECTION.
             * You could in theory
             * also choose to support SELFLAG_REMOVESELECTION for a non-multi-selectable
             * component that allowed the user to force a null selection, but in practice
             * most non-multi-selectable components do not work this way, and MSAA clients
             * may not attempt this type of operation.If you encounter flags that seem invalid, set errno to E_INVALIDARG.Finally, note that when accSelect is called, Flash Player
             * ensures that it has host focus (the window focus of its container
             * application), and that your component has focus within Flash Player.
             * @param   operation   A bitfield consisting of one or more selection flag constants to indicate
             *   how the item is selected or takes focus.
             * @param   childID An unsigned integer corresponding to one of the component's child elements
             *   as defined by getChildIDArray().
